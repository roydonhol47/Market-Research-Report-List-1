<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Lung Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Venovenous (VV) Artificial Lung Devices</li><li>Venoarterial (VA) Artificial Lung Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial lung devices market is primarily divided into two types: Venovenous (VV) and Venoarterial (VA) devices. VV artificial lungs are designed for patients with severe respiratory failure, facilitating gas exchange by oxygenating blood returned to the heart without affecting circulation. In contrast, VA devices support both oxygenation and circulation by delivering oxygen-rich blood to the body directly from the device, making them suitable for patients with both respiratory and cardiac failure. Both types are vital in critical care settings.</p></p>
