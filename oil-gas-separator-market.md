<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil & Gas Separator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravitational</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Oil & Gas Separator market comprises two primary types: gravitational separators and centrifugal separators. Gravitational separators utilize the natural force of gravity to separate oil, gas, and water based on their density differences, making them cost-effective for onshore applications. In contrast, centrifugal separators employ high rotational forces to enhance the separation process, achieving higher efficiency in challenging conditions, often offshore. Both types are essential for ensuring optimal hydrocarbon recovery and minimizing environmental impact in oil and gas operations.</p></p>
